			This site is dedicated to making accessible the key documents, films, blogs, and publications
			of a movement of Chinese people seeking to reclaim their country's history. Unlike official
			government or university archives, the China Unofficial Archives is open, free, and accessible
			to anyone from any walk of life. The site is fully bilingual in Chinese and English, the
			international language of scholarship.
